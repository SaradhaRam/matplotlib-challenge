# Pymaceuticals Data Analysis:
    
    1.From Boxplot
         1.a) From the box plot we can understand that the Capomulin and Ramicane are performing well on tumor volume 
        size(reduction)and in that two (Capomulin and Ramicane) Capomulin is slight better than Ramicane because the 
        median is close to upper quartile(q3).
         1.b)Infubinol and Ceftamin are not performing well compare to Capomulin and Ramicane.
            
    2.From Scatter plot  and linear regression.
        2.a) From the scatter plot we can understand that the the mouse average weight is correlated with average tumor
        volume size. it is linear and positively correlated.  
        2.b) From the linear regression the graph,it is sloping upward.It tells that it is strongly associated with the data.
        Meaning that if there is increase in average mouse weight then the average tumor volume is increasing. The correlation
        coefficient (r) value is 0.88, indicating a strong association to a linear positive correlation (sloping upward).
    
    3.From the Line graph:
        3.a) The line plot clearly tells that the change over time what happens to the tumor volume. 
        A sample of a mouse (mouse ID -"f966") which is using the Capomulin Drug is taken for study.The line plot is 
        starting from upper value and going downwards as time increases. That means the tumor volume is reduced over
        incerase in time.
        * In conclution Which tells that the Capomulin Drug is good for reducing the tumor volume of a mouse.
